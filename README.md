# GeoWeb-BrowserTests
This is a repository of many test tools which are used to test GeoWeb.

## Frontend
The front-end directory contains automated browser tests using Selenium WebDriver.
While it manipulates GeoWeb using the frontend it is actually a "full-chain" test, potentially touching the entire infrastructure.
